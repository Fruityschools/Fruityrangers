Fruity Trees for Wealthy and Healthy Communities
We are a registered not-for-profit, non-governmental organisation. We grow certified fruit trees in schools, health centres, and smallholder farms as a climate change mitigation measure, a food and nutrition security strategy and a carbon offsetting project.
